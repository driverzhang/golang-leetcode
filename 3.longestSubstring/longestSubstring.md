#  3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

> Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.


给定一个字符串，找出不含有重复字符的最长子串的长度。

### Example:

```go
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
